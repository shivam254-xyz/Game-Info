  <h2>About the Game</h2>
  <p>
Resident Evil is a legendary survival horror game series known for its intense
atmosphere, limited resources, and deep storytelling. Players explore dangerous
environments filled with zombies and biological threats while uncovering dark
secrets.<br><br>

Resident Evil is one of the most influential survival horror game franchises in
gaming history. Developed by Capcom, the series introduced players to a world
filled with biological experiments, zombies, and terrifying creatures created
by deadly viruses. The games focus heavily on atmosphere, tension, and limited
resources, forcing players to think carefully before every action.<br><br>

A key feature of Resident Evil is its emphasis on survival rather than action.
Players must manage ammunition, health items, and save points while exploring
dark and dangerous environments such as abandoned mansions, ruined cities, and
secret laboratories. This creates constant fear and suspense, which defines the
franchise.<br><br>

The series is also known for its strong storytelling. Resident Evil explores
themes like corporate greed, unethical scientific experiments, and the
consequences of human ambition. Characters such as Leon S. Kennedy, Jill
Valentine, and Chris Redfield have become iconic due to their deep development
across multiple games.<br><br>

Over time, Resident Evil has evolved by introducing new gameplay styles,
including action-oriented combat and first-person horror, while still
maintaining its core identity. Modern remakes and new releases have helped the
franchise remain relevant, making it a perfect example of how classic games can
adapt to modern gaming standards.

  <h2>About the Game</h2>
<p>
Subnautica is an open-world survival adventure game developed and published by
Unknown Worlds Entertainment. The game is set on an alien ocean planet known as
4546B, where the player becomes the lone survivor of a spaceship crash. With no
land to explore, players must dive into vast underwater environments to gather
resources, build tools, and uncover the mystery of the planet.<br><br>

The gameplay of Subnautica focuses on exploration, survival, and crafting.
Players must manage vital needs such as oxygen, health, food, and water while
navigating dangerous underwater biomes filled with both peaceful and hostile
alien creatures. As players progress, they can construct underwater bases,
vehicles, and advanced equipment to explore deeper and more dangerous areas of
the ocean.<br><br>

The core gameplay of Subnautica revolves around exploration, resource
management, and crafting. Players must constantly monitor essential survival
needs such as oxygen, food, water, and health while diving deeper into the
ocean. As depth increases, pressure and hostile creatures make survival more
challenging, pushing players to upgrade equipment and technology.<br><br>

A key feature of Subnautica is base-building and vehicle construction. Players
can create underwater bases for safety and storage, as well as build vehicles
such as the Seamoth, Cyclops, and Prawn Suit to explore deeper regions. These
systems give players freedom to customize their playstyle and expand their
reach across the planet.<br><br>

A major strength of Subnautica is its immersive atmosphere and environmental
storytelling. Instead of traditional missions, the game reveals its story
through exploration, abandoned data logs, and environmental clues. This allows
players to uncover the planet’s secrets at their own pace while maintaining a
sense of mystery and tension.<br><br>

Subnautica is widely praised for its unique underwater setting, strong sense of
isolation, and balance between beauty and danger. Its combination of survival
mechanics, exploration, and subtle storytelling makes it one of the most
memorable survival games in modern gaming.

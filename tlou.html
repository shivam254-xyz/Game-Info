  <h2>About the Game</h2>
<p>
The Last of Us is a critically acclaimed action-adventure survival game known
for its emotional storytelling and realistic characters. Set in a
post-apocalyptic world devastated by a fungal infection, the game follows the
journey of Joel and Ellie as they struggle to survive in a harsh and dangerous
environment filled with infected creatures and hostile human groups.<br><br>

Developed by Naughty Dog, The Last of Us focuses heavily on narrative and
character development rather than fast-paced action. The game emphasizes
realistic survival mechanics, where players must carefully manage limited
resources such as ammunition, crafting materials, and health supplies. This
creates a tense and immersive gameplay experience that keeps players constantly
on edge.<br><br>

A key strength of The Last of Us is its emotional depth. The relationship
between Joel and Ellie evolves throughout the journey, exploring themes of
loss, hope, trust, and moral choices. The game presents difficult decisions
that blur the line between right and wrong, making the story feel mature and
impactful.<br><br>

Over the years, The Last of Us has become one of the most influential
story-driven games in modern gaming history. Its cinematic presentation,
powerful soundtrack, and deep storytelling have set new standards for narrative
design in video games, proving that games can deliver experiences as emotional
and meaningful as films or novels.<br>

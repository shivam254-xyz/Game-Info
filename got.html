  <h2>About the Game</h2>
<p>
Ghost of Tsushima is an action-adventure game developed by Sucker Punch
Productions and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The game is set in
13th-century Japan during the Mongol invasion of Tsushima Island. Players take
on the role of Jin Sakai, a samurai warrior who must protect his homeland while
questioning the traditional code of honor he was raised with.<br><br>

The gameplay focuses on open-world exploration, sword-based combat, and stealth.
Players can choose to fight enemies honorably as a samurai or use stealth
techniques as the “Ghost” to defeat powerful foes. This dual playstyle allows
players to approach combat in multiple ways, making gameplay flexible and
engaging.<br><br>

A major strength of Ghost of Tsushima is its beautiful world design and
atmosphere. The game features vast landscapes, forests, mountains, and fields
inspired by traditional Japanese art. Environmental elements such as wind,
falling leaves, and weather guide players naturally without heavy use of on-screen
markers, creating a cinematic and immersive experience.<br><br>

Ghost of Tsushima is praised for its storytelling, visuals, and combat system.
The game explores themes of honor, sacrifice, and identity while delivering an
emotional journey set against a historical backdrop. Its blend of action,
storytelling, and artistic presentation makes it one of the most celebrated
open-world games of its generation.

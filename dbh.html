  <h2>About the Game</h2>
<p>
Detroit: Become Human is a 2018 adventure game developed by Quantic Dream and
published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The game is set in a futuristic
Detroit where highly advanced androids designed to serve humans begin to
develop sentience. Players control three playable androids — Kara, Connor, and
Markus — whose stories explore freedom, identity, and the value of life.<br><br>

The gameplay focuses on narrative and player choice, with decisions affecting
the story’s outcome and character relationships. Each character’s journey
offers a unique perspective: Kara’s struggle to protect a young girl, Connor’s
role as an investigator hunting rogue androids, and Markus’s leadership in
seeking freedom for sentient machines. The game’s plot branches based on
choices, making player decisions central to the experience.<br><br>

Detroit: Become Human is heavily focused on player choice and consequence.
Almost every decision affects the storyline, character relationships, and even
who survives. The game features multiple branching paths and endings, making
each playthrough unique. A flowchart system shows how decisions influence the
story, encouraging replayability.<br><br>

The game follows three main android characters: Kara, Connor, and Markus. Each
character represents a different perspective on android existence. Kara
focuses on themes of empathy and protection, Connor explores duty and logic as
an android investigator, and Markus represents rebellion and the fight for
freedom. Their stories intersect and evolve based on the choices made by the
player.<br><br>

Detroit: Become Human is praised for its cinematic presentation, emotional
storytelling, and detailed graphics. The motion capture performances and
impactful narrative choices give the game a deep interactive drama feel, with
each playthrough potentially leading to different endings. The themes of
autonomy and humanity make it one of the most memorable narrative games of its
generation.
